# 3. Using Conda for the projects involving math based packages

Date: 2025-02-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The issue motivating this decision, and any context that influences or constrains the decision.
Pip was used for package management before. We have math based packages like matplotlib and cartopy. It is easier to use Conda instead. 

## Decision

The change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement.
Conda was chosen since it being easier to install math based packages and their dependcies

## Consequences

While Conda is easier to use for math packages and dependencies, there could be issues and conflicts of installed packages. This is something to keep in mind.
